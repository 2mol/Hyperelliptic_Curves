Dear Mr. Chom=E9,


Good. Maybe you are getting a feel for the addition law now. I just =20
wanted to see the rule written down, not necessarily with =20
justification. The journal and book literature mostly uses algebra or =20=

geometry of various degrees of sophistication, except for the article =20=

by Menezes et al. My aim was to keep it elementary in line with the =20
axiom

and following the exposition in my first elliptic curves course.


Best wishes,
David Masser.
