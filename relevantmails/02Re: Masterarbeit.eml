Dear Mr. Chom=E9,


Yes, char K =3D 2 would be excluded, and it would be strange if not also =
=20
char 3 and even 5. I don't want to bother with y^2+H(x)y =3D D(x), for =20=

example.

I would start as in EK1 with a detailed definition of addition, over =20
some field K. I remember that it makes quite a difference to the =20
exposition according to whether K is algebraically closed or not. =20
Already for elliptic curves there were six cases, and I expect =20
somewhat more here. The procedure with cubic y=3DC(x) works provided the =
=20
x-coordinates (perhaps call them x1,u1,x2,u2) of P1,Q1,P2,Q2 are =20
different; one gets a sextic polynomial C(x)^2 - D(x) of which four =20
roots are known. The other two roots give the x-coordinates of P3,Q3. =20=

Of course the resulting formulae will be rather long. It may be =20
helpful to assume that the coefficient of x^4 in D(x), itself monic of =20=

course, is zero (this would be tricky in char 5). The remaining =20
coefficients could be a,b,c,d, to avoid too many subscripts.

By limiting arguments I mean taking for example x1 and u1 very close =20
numerically and seeing what happens to these other two roots =20
numerically. Or it may be possible to do it informally by a picture. =20
There will be further cases depending on the relation between y1 and =20
v1, just as in EK1. Then x1 and x2 close, and so on.


Best wishes,
David Masser.
