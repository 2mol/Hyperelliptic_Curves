P.S. A side issue is the behaviour of addition in non-algebraically =20
closed fields K. If P1,Q1,P2,Q2 are defined over K then you will find =20=

that in general P3,Q3 are defined only over a quadratic extension of =20
K, due to a quadratic equation. This can be improved by defining =20
properly the notion that a pair {P,Q} is defined over K. If P=3D(x,y) =20=

and Q=3D(u,v) then this would mean that every function of x,y,u,v over =20=

the rationals {\bf Q} that is "doubly symmetric" or =20
"bisymmetric" (invariant under the interchange of P and Q) is in K. =20
The set of such bisymmetric functions is a field containing x+u,xu,y=20
+v,yv but I think it is not generated over {\bf Q} by these four =20
functions; for example also (x-u)/(y-v) is there. See Cassels and =20
Flynn p. 6 (but I have this book from the library). One can find =20
generators in a sufficiently old-fashioned algebra textbook (or maybe =20=

google "bisymmetric").

But don't let this distract you now from the addition law.
