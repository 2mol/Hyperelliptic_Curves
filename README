Big TODO List:

- Add remarks in regard to the illustrations: only a slight geometrical-visual aid, nothing more...
<OK- Illustrations -> all special cases for p3 not 0 ?
- Prove "switching". Or "prove" switching.
- Write Chapter 0 - Wait for Masser's input
<OK--- Consistent eqn numbering
- References/bibliography
- changes in CH1 as announced in the note before CH3


-- Bonus stage:
halving of points
OH -Provide Examples (Half Bonus & discuss with Masser first)
switching for larger sums


-- Questions to Masser & myself:
-----------------
-Lemma under 1.5, replace all \rightleftharpoons by "and"?
-Is the question of "assuming K algebraically closed or not" resolved?
-prove thm 1?
-(F) write as a comment/note?
-little problem with 'first part' comment on top/exclusion of the zero case: is it a problem that f is not unique (better expressed: that f depends on how we write the sum?)? Could be no problem...
