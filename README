Big TODO List:

- Add remarks in regard to the illustrations: only a slight geometrical-visual aid, nothing more...

OK- Illustrations -> all special cases for p3 not 0 ?

- Prove "switching". Or "prove" switching.

- Provide Examples (Half Bonus & discuss with Masser first)

- Write Chapter 0 - Wait for Masser's input



-- Small TODO:
Consistent eqn numbering
References/bibliography
changes in CH1 as announced in the note before CH3



-- Bonus stage:
halving of points
switching for larger sums


-- Questions to Masser & myself:
-----------------
Lemma under 1.5, replace all \rightleftharpoons by "and"?
Is the question of "assuming K algebraically closed or not" resolved?
prove thm 1?
