Big TODO List:

<OK-plusminus- Add remarks in regard to the illustrations: only a slight geometrical-visual aid, nothing more...
<OK- Illustrations -> all special cases for p3 not 0 ?
<OK- Prove "switching". Or "prove" switching.
- Write Chapter 0 - Wait for Masser's input
<OK--- Consistent eqn numbering
- References/bibliography
<OK- changes in CH1 as announced in the note before CH3
<OK- as above, but in graphics! fuck...
<OK (check)- take out char K = 5


-- Bonus stage:
On hold -- halving of points
On hold -- Provide Examples (Half Bonus & discuss with Masser first)
switching for larger sums


-- Questions to Masser & myself:
-----------------
-Lemma under 1.5, replace all \rightleftharpoons by "and"?
-Is the question of "assuming K algebraically closed or not" resolved?
- Yes - do this! <-prove thm 1?
-(F) write as a comment/note?
- Resolved I think -> little problem with 'first part' comment on top/exclusion of the zero case: is it a problem that f is not unique (better expressed: that f depends on how we write the sum?)? Could be no problem...
- Weierstrass points <- clarification? I don't know how to formulate. And do I include \infty or not? Pretty sure the way I put it isn't really right.
-remark that thm2 kind of depends how the sum is written? so divisor not unique.
